# ssus
<div class="markdown-body">
          <p>This is a script for ircII-EPIC4 -- untar in your home directory.  It will create $HOME/.ss<br>
It's kinda hardcoded at the moment for $HOME/.ss so yeah.<br>
In your $HOME/.ircrc add the command<br>
'load ~/.ss/ss.scr'<br>
And away you go on a journey of beautiful IRCing.<br>
Check out the /themes for some nice simple themes<br>
/config to configure ssus and client settings</p>
<ul>
<li>you can set things such as autoreply (bold another users handle when they refer to your nickname, or various nicknames)</li>
<li>public status messages such as /away and /back (default 0 because no one cares)</li>
<li>stripping color codes</li>
<li>changing your CTCP replies</li>
<li>Quit/kick message</li>
<li>Your tab-complete character (default ':' but I have a serious partiality for ',')</li>
<li>PC Speaker BEEP on autoreply</li>
</ul>
<p>/cwho - prints a beautiful sorted list of channel users, can take various flags too /cwho o <em>aol.com</em> to list chanops from aol hostname<br>
/dict to look up a word<br>
/cfind to look up a country code<br>
/cloak to halt CTCP replying (for CTCP floods)<br>
/cycle to join and part a channel (optional argument of a part message for newer servers)<br>
standard op commands, /op, /deop, /k, /kb etc<br>
/tig - ignore list that CAN BE SAVED! woo<br>
/grep for regex</p>
<ul>
<li>/away and /back - standard away management<br>
/slog to configure logging - ssus has great logging features, saves in ~/sslogs by default<br>
ok whatever theres tons of other stuff, type /alias to see full list<br>
all the stubs can be found in the modules subdir and it's probably pretty self explanatory what they do to an autistic 14 year old.</li>
</ul>
        </div>
